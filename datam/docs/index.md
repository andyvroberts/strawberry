## Introduction

A modern data model includes many practical facets and can be presented in many different formats.  It must serve multiple purposes and be of utility to both technology teams and business users.  Data Models are used in the following two contexts:      

### 1. Data Governance
Examples of models used in data governance include:   

- business taxonomies.  
- semantic data definitions.   
- critical data element lists.    
- master/reference data formation.  
- conceptual/logical ER diagrams.  

### 2. Data Management
The activities that manage physical data.  
Usually, this involves ensuring that the correct data is provided to the correct process at the time when it is required, and no later.  

Examples of models used in data management include:  

- storage models such as database schemas and big data container layouts.  
- integration models such as data contracts, interface specifications and API payload schemas.  
- physical ER diagrams.
