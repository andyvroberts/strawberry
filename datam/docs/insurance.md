# Insurance


## Risk Category  
There are 6 types risk categories, which are used to demonstrate what is and what is not insurable.  
### Can be Insured:
#### Financial Risk 
A risk where the outcome of an adverse event can be measured in financial terms.  
For example, theft of property, loss of business profits following a fire, and legal liabilty in the case of personal injury compensation, etc.

#### Particular Risk 
Particular risks are localised or personal in their cause and effect.  
Even if the cause is sometimes widespread, in the case of a storm within a region, the effect is usually localised to an individual (the region cannot be insured, but a house can).  
For example, a factory fire, a car collision, theft of personal possessions, etc.   

#### Pure Risk 
Where there is the possiblity of a loss, but not of a gain.  For example, risk of fire, risk of machinary breakdown, risk of employee injury.  

### Cannot be Insured:
#### Fundamental Risk 
Uninsurable risks that arise from social, economic, political or natural causes and are widespread in their effect.  
Or, events that occur on such a vast scale that they are uninsurable.  For example, economic recession, famine, war, etc.  

#### Non-Financial Risk 
Where a risk cannot be measured only in financial terms.  For example, sentimental value cannot be insured (although the market value can be).

#### Speculative Risk 
Speculation with the intent of making a financial gain cannot be insured.   For example, investments, gambling, starting a business, etc. 

## Risk Features
### Fortuitous Event 
A risk event must be accidental or unexptected, and not inevitable.  Also, it must not be deliberate on the part of the insured.   

### Insurable Interest 
The legally recognised financial relationship between the insured and the object or liability.  
For example, it is only possible for you to insure your own car, and not a car belonging to another.  

### Public Policy
An insurer must not cover risks that are against public policy.  
For example, the risk of incurring a fine for a criminal offence is uninsurable.   

### Homogenous Exposure 
Historical patterns and trends of similar exposures and risks enable insurers to forecast (see the law of large numbers) the expected extent of future losses.   
Whereas a fortuitous event, insurable interest, and not being against public policy are absolute requirements as risk feature, a Homogenous Exposure is only an ideal.  


## General Defintions
### Compulsory Insurance  
Some types of insurance are mandated through either governaments or regulatory bodies.  
For example, car insurance, employers liability.

### Endorsement
Usually some change to the insured risk/liability, where the insurer must be advised of the change.  For example, an increase in the value of a property.  
Endorsements can trigger processing that alters the Premium paid by the insured, or how the insurance company accounts for the Premium.  

### Equitable Premium
Pooling systems for each main risk grouping (e.g. Marine, Aviation Hull, Property, etc.) are comprised of many premium contributions.  
The insurer must decide on an equitable contribution for each insured risk in the pool, by taking into account varying elements, known as *discrimination factors*.  

### Frequency (of a risk)
How often an event associated with a Risk may be exptected to occur.  Usually determined by forecasting or statistical analysis.  

### Fulfilment
When an insurance contract has been fully performed.  Either the contract has expired or has paid out to the maximum possible claim value.  
For example, if a policy can pay out a maximum of Â£1,000 in a policy year, and it has paid out that amount within the first 3 months then the contract has been fulfilled.  The policy will remain in-force but cannot respond to any more claims.  

### Hazard
A hazard influences the operation or effect of a peril.   
For example, a werehouse fire is a peril.  But the fact that sprinklers are not installed is a hazard which means that the fire has a greater effect.  Examples of the hazards that can be linked with Perils are:  
  
|Peril |Hazard |
|--|--|
|Explosion | smoking is permitted near flamable materials |
|Lightening | inadequate lightening conductors on buildings |
|Collision | lack of driver training or non-visible speed limit signage |
|Dishonesty |  poor security or operational controls to prevent theft |

#### i. Physical Hazard
The physical characteristics of a risk that includes any measurable dimension.  The characteristics can increase or decrease the possibilty of a peril.  
For example, property construction quality, age of car drivers.  

#### ii. Moral Hazard
Arises from the attitude and behaviour of people.  
For example, careless or lax management in a factory represents poor moral hazard.  

### Indemnity (Policy)
To provide the specific financial compensation that restores the financial position of an insured, as if the loss had not happened.  Indemnification ensures that the insured cannot make a profit from a loss.  However, not all insurance policies are contracts of indemnity.  

### Inception
When the insurance contract comes into effect.  Usually a mutually agreed date.  
For insurance contracts, the duty of disclosure of material facts sometimes ends at the inception date.  After this, there is no requirement for the insured to declare material facts, unless they affect the policy cover.   

### Insurance
  
|Function |Benefit |
|-|-|
|Primary |Spread risk between the insured, insurance companies and reinsurance companies. |
|Primary |Provide a degree of certainty in exchange for a premium payment. |
|Primary |Transfer of risk.  An insurer will accept financial risk and charge a premium in return. |
|Secondary |No need to set aside large sums of money for dealing with losses. |
|Secondary |Provides the confidence for companies to expand their businesses. |
|Secondary |Job protection through compensation in the event of an unfortunate event. |
|Secondary |Financial losses are reduced in size and number. |
|Secondary |Premium reserves (the accumulation of premiums) held by insurers means they can be investors of funds. |

### Law of Large Numbers
When operating a pool, insurers benefit (rely on) the law of large numbers.  
The law states that given a large number of similar situations, the actual number of events occuring tends towards the expected number.  

Applying this statistical ruile to insurance, enables the insurer to confidently predict the final cost of claims within a given (underwriting) year.  

### Market Reform Contract
The London Market risk proposal form.  These are drawn up by insurance brokers where the risk details are documented for consideration by an Insurer.  

### Peril
If a risk event occurs for an insured, a peril may give rise to a loss.  
For example, a fire, flood, explosion, lightening, collision, dishonesty.  Perils may be named as the cause of a loss.  

|Peril Category |Definition |
|-|-|
|Insured Peril |Named in the policy as covered |
|Excepted/Excluded Peril |Named in the policy as specifically not covered |
|Uninsured/Unnamed Peril |Those perils not mentioned at all in the policy |  

Claims are assessed based on which category was the [Proximate Cause](#proximate-cause) of the loss.  For complex polices where various perils are insured under differing conditions, the following rules apply:  
1.  if one of the perils is excluded then no claim is paid  
2.  if one of the perils is not mentioned (neither inlcuded nor excluded) then the whole claim will be paid    

### Pooling of Risk
The losses of a few insured clients who suffer misfortune are covered by the contributions of the many insured clients who, although exposed to similar risks, do not need to make a claim.  

An insurer who gathers many small individual sums of money from those who want to be pretected from similar kinds of perils, sets itself up to operate a pool.  Insurers operate many separate pools for each different class of insurance they underwrite. Payments from the Pool are made to compensate only the few.  

### Proposal Form
Constructed by an insurer in order to discover all relevant information relating to a risk.  Usually these are sets of questions used to obtain material disclosures from the Proposer.  

In the London Market, risk are not placed using a proposal form, but by using a [Market Reform Contract](#market-reform-contract).  

### Proximate Cause
The dominant cause ([peril](#peril)) of a loss resulting in a claim.  

An insurance policy covers a particular loss (risk/liability) caused by an insured peril.  If the peril is covered by the policy, then a claim will be paid.  For example, an earthquake may cause a fire that damages a house.  The house insurance policy covers fire but does not cover earthquakes.  Because the fire was caused by the earthquake (there would otherwise have been no fire), it is the earthquake that is the *Proximate Cause*, and a claim will not be paid.

Therefore, the valid relationship between the cause and the loss is called the proximate cause.  

### Risk
There is no universally recognised definition of risk.  It can have many different meanings depending on the context.  However, to be insurable a risk must fall into one of the insurable risk categories and comply with the Risk Features.  

|Is Insurable |Risk Category |
|-|-|
|Yes |Financial
|Yes |Pure |
|Yes |Particular |
|No |Non-Financial |
|No |Speculative |
|No |Fundamental | 


All *insurable* risks must also meet the following Risk Features:  
Have a Fortuitous Event.  
Have an Insurable Interest.  
Have a risk that is not against public policy.  

### Risk Management
The identification, analysis and economic control of defined risks which can threaten assets or earning capacity.   

### Risk Transfer
The process of insurance.  Where a third party assumes the financial consequences of a risk occuring.  

### Severity
The seriousness of the consequences when a risk occurs.  Usually measured as a financial value.
